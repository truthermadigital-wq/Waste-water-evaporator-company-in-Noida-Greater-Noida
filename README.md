# Waste-water-evaporator-company-in-Noida-Greater-Noida
Located in the Industrial Area, Trutherma Engineers and Consultants LLP has emerged as a premier manufacturer of industrial wastewater evaporators in Greater Noida. While many companies offer broad water treatment solutions, Integro is specifically recognized for its high-efficiency thermal evaporation systems. Their approach focuses on reducing effluent volume to the absolute minimum, helping businesses bridge the gap between "treatment" and "complete disposal.
Why They Lead the Market:
The QuickEvap Series: They offer a specialized range of evaporators with capacities from 20 LPH to 750 LPH. This modularity is ideal for small to medium enterprises (SMEs) that need to manage RO reject or oily effluents without a massive infrastructure overhaul.
Material Durability: Given the corrosive nature of industrial brine and chemical waste, Trutherma utilizes SS316L and specialized coated carbon steel to ensure their plants withstand harsh environments.
Automation: Their systems are equipped with PLC-based controls, allowing for automatic temperature regulation and safety management, which reduces the need for constant manual supervision.
Energy Optimization: A major pain point for evaporation is energy cost. Trutherma integrates heat recovery systems to minimize the power required per liter of water evaporated.
